</p>

Simple example on how to work with JWT using Node.js and Express.js with VSCode running in WSL with Ubuntu distro.

>**Disclaimer:** I was heavily inspired by [this great video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbsmsi7l3r4) by [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw)

# Prerequisites
* [Visual Studio Code on WSL](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl)
    * VSCode extension [Remote - WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl)
    * VSCode extension [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) - you can use any other REST client you are comfortable with, e.g. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
    We will use it to test the calls to the API endpoints we're going to create
* [nvm, node.js and npm](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl#install-nvm-nodejs-and-npm) on WSL (the instructions are perfectly OK for WSL 1, too)

>**Note**: Actually you don't need to use VSCode or WSL, it's up to you. I chose this combination because
* VSCode is a great IDE and works very well with Node.js
* It has a very powerful integrated terminal 
* I like Bash shell more than Windows PowerShell or Cmd
