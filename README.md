  <h1 align="center">JWT + Node.js + Express Tutorial</h1>
</p>

Simple example on how to work with _JWT_ using _Node.js_ and _Express.js_ with _VSCode_ running in _WSL_ with _Ubuntu_ distro.

>**Disclaimer:** I was heavily inspired by [this great video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbsmsi7l3r4) by [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw)

# Prerequisites
* [Visual Studio Code on WSL](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl)
    * VSCode extension [Remote - WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl)
    * VSCode extension [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) - you can use any other REST client you are comfortable with, e.g. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
    You will use it to test the calls to the API endpoints we're going to create
* [nvm, node.js and npm](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl#install-nvm-nodejs-and-npm) on _WSL_ (the instructions are perfectly OK for _WSL 1_, too) - install the recommended LTS version of the node.js

>**Note:** Actually you don't need to use _VSCode_ or _WSL_, it's up to you. I chose this combination because:
* VSCode is a great IDE and works very well with Node.js
* It has a very powerful integrated terminal 
* I like Bash shell more than Windows PowerShell or Cmd 

# Setting up the Workspace
There are several ways to open the _WSL_ prompt, one is to hit <kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to open the _Run_ dialog and typing `wsl` into the text box followed by <kbd>ENTER</kbd>. A _WSL_ prompt should open like this:

![WSL Prompt](images/wsl-prompt.png)

Next, you're going to create a `vscode` dir in your user home directory and clone this repository into it. In _WSL_ prompt, type:
```
cd ~ && mkdir vscode && cd vscode/
```
```
git clone https://github.com/krokyk/jwt-nodejs-express-tutorial.git
```
>**:bulb: TIP:** You can also clone the repository using SSH but you need to [setup your SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) first:
>```
>git clone git@github.com:krokyk/jwt-nodejs-express-tutorial.git
>```

>**:bulb: TIP:** You can also just [download the ZIP](https://github.com/krokyk/jwt-nodejs-express-tutorial/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) archive of this project from github and unzip it into the `vscode` dir (rename the folder to `jwt-nodejs-express-tutorial` if necessary).

Now, launch _VSCode_ in the newly created dir
```
code jwt-nodejs-express-tutorial/
```
You can close _WSL_ prompt now.
You will be working exclusively in _VSCode_ from now on.

# Initial Content of the Project

You can ignore the `images` dir (it contains images for this readme) and `.vscode` (workspace configuration for this project) but take a look into the one called `chapter-src`.

This dir holds files arranged into subdirs.
Each subdir reflects a step in the project's "evolution" as the files are created/changed during the course of this tutorial.
These subdirs are numbered and each subdir represents a certain state of the project content.
The subchapters are numbered as well and their number corresponds to the subdir names.
After you finish one subchapter, your files in the root of the project should have the same (or very very similar) content as those you find in `chapter-src` under subdir with the same number as the chapter you just finished.

>**:bulb: TIP:** It's helpful to compare the contents of the project dir with each of the subdirs in `chapter-src` dir as you go through the tutorial chapters to make sure you did not make any mistake.
You can use any tool that is able to compare the directory contents and easily display changed files and then compare those files to see what the change from that chapter is.
My tool of choice for that is [Beyond Compare](https://www.scootersoftware.com/).

# 01 - Initialize the Project

If you do not have a terminal opened yet, hit <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> or go to the _Terminal &rarr; New Terminal_ in the menu bar.
Type this in your terminal:
```
npm init -y
```
>**:information_source: INFO:** File `package.json` was created with some default values derived from our current content.

# 02 - Install Required Libraries

```
npm install express jsonwebtoken dotenv
```
* `express` for our server code and API endpoints
* `jsonwebtoken` for working with _JWT_
* `dotenv` to store our sensitive and configuration stuff inside the `.env` file (like secrets or ports)

Install the development dependency `nodemon` which will automatically restart the server as you make changes to the code:
```
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

>**:information_source: INFO:** Another file called `package-lock.json` and whole subdir called `node_modules` were created.

# 03 - Create Project Files

```
touch apiServer.js && touch .env
```
* `apiServer.js` will contain our API code
* `.env` will contain our configuration

Inside the `package.json`, hook the `nodemon` to run newly created `apiServer.js`:
```json
  "scripts": {
    "apiStart": "nodemon apiServer.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
```
You can now try to run the `apiServer.js` with `nodemon`:

```
npm run apiStart
```
![Nodemon starts](images/03-01.png)

Now, without quitting the server, try adding
```javascript
console.log("Hi!")
```
to the `apiServer.js` and you should see the output in the terminal immediately after you save the file, because `nodemon` is monitoring it.

![Nodemon refreshes the server](images/03-02.png)

# 04 - Letâ€™s Create API Server

Add `API_SERVER_PORT` env variable to `.env` file:
```properties
API_SERVER_PORT=3000
```
And this to the empty `apiServer.js`:
```javascript
require("dotenv").config()
const PORT = process.env.API_SERVER_PORT

const express = require("express")
const app = express()

app.listen(PORT)
```
It will do nothing yet, just listen on the port configured via `.env`.

# 05 - Return Some Data

Create a <kbd>GET</kbd>`/posts` endpoint in `apiServer.js` that returns a simple JSON object containing 2 posts:
```javascript
const posts = [
    {
        author: "Jane",
        title: "Post 1"
    },
    {
        author: "John",
        title: "Post 2"
    }
]

app.get("/posts", (req, res) => {
    res.json(posts)
})
```
You can test the endpoint by opening http://localhost:3000/posts in your browser.
But we're going to...

<div id="06"></div>

# 06 - Use the [REST Client Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) to Display Data

It can run requests defined in the `*.rest` files.
File can contain multiple requests separated by three (or more) `###`.
Create file `requests.rest` in your project by running this in terminal:
```
touch requests.rest
```
With following content:
```http
#######################################
GET http://localhost:3000/posts
```
In the editor, it will look like this:

![requests.rest](images/06-01.png)

Now, you can click on `Send Request` and the resulting response will open in the new split window:

![Response](images/06-02.png)

This is all nice, but what if you don't want to display the whole content to anyone, but only the content they are authors of?
You need to add some authentication and authorization to the server to do that.

# 07 - Add an Authentication Endpoint

* Create a <kbd>POST</kbd>`/login` endpoint in `apiServer.js`.
* It's <kbd>POST</kbd>, because you are going to be sending data (credentials) to the server.
* Since the request body will be in a JSON format, you need to tell that to the server by configuring the middleware, so it understands the body of such requests. To configure _Express.js_ in such a way use this construct:
  ```javascript
  app.use(express.json())
  ```
  >**:information_source: INFO:** In short, middleware are those methods/functions/operations that are called **_between_** receiving the request and  sending back the response.
* The endpoint should take care of the authentication of the user, but this is not in scope of this tutorial.
  You can just assume the authentication was successful and the user really is who he claims to be.
  Add this to the `apiServer.js`:
  ```javascript
  app.post("/login", (req, res) => {
    // Authenticate user
  })
  ```
* So take the `username` from the request body and use it in creation of `user` object that will be stored inside the generated token. Add this to the <kbd>POST</kbd>`/login` endpoint method:
  ```javascript
    const username = req.body.username
    const user = { name: username }
  ```
* Import the `jsonwebtoken` library.
  ```javascript
  const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken")
  ```
* To create the token and send it back to the client, add this to the <kbd>POST</kbd>`/login` endpoint method:
  ```javascript
    const accessToken = jwt.sign(user, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)
    res.json({ accessToken: accessToken })
  ```
* Store the secret inside the `.env` file. You can use _Node.js_ `crypto` library to generate a strong secret (e.g. 64 random bytes converted to a hexadecimal string). Paste this into **terminal** (yes, you can paste the whole line, including the comment :wink:):
  ```bash
  node -p "require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex')" # -p prints out the evaluated input
  ```
  Each time you run that a new random string is generated.XXX
  Create `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` environment variable in the `.env` file with that value, e.g.:
  ```properties
  ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=9fef66c25daba5b9a28a59f82e4bd799c83d891f4dae047c27c60796c0b5a9732cf66b87c21836f8df1ef8580de72b4c5d1197a6e811063d3b1ed03ed4fb8bb7
  ```

# 08 - Test the POST `/login` Endpoint

Add the <kbd>POST</kbd>`/login` request to the `requests.rest`:
```http
#######################################
POST http://localhost:3000/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "username": "Jane",
    "password": "abcd"
}
```

The response will look like this:

![Response](images/08-01.png)

That gibberish is actually our access token holding the information we've put in it (our `user` JSON object) along with some other stuff, added automatically by the `jsonwebtoken` library.
>**:bulb: TIP:** You can actually head out to the [official JWT page](https://jwt.io/) and paste your token there to see what's in it.

# 09 - Verify the Access Token in the Middleware

* in `apiServer.js` create a middleware function (or _route handler_) called `verifyToken`
  ```javascript
  function verifyToken(req, res, next) {
      
  }
  ```
* add it to the <kbd>GET</kbd>`/posts` endpoint to the chain of our _route handlers_
  ```javascript
  app.get("/posts", verifyToken, (req, res) => {
      res.json(posts)
  })
  ```
Inside `verifyToken` function:
* extract the _Authorization_ header from the request
  ```javascript
      const authHeader = req.headers["authorization"]
  ```
* Verify there is actually such header and if yes, get the token from it.
Since _Authorization_ header value will be in format `Bearer <token>`, split it (on the `space` character) and take the second array element from it
  ```javascript
      const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(" ")[1]
  ```
* if the header is not there or the value of the header is malformed somehow (e.g. there's no space between `Bearer` and `<token>`), return **_401 Unauthorized_** HTTP status
  ```javascript
      if (token == null) return res.sendStatus(401)
  ```
* otherwise, proceed to the verification of the token itself.
If there's an error, return **_403 Forbidden_** HTTP status. If not, pass the control to the `next` _route handler_ in sequence
  ```javascript
      jwt.verify(token, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, (err, obj) => {
          if (err) return res.sendStatus(403)
          next()
      })
  ```

# 10 - Test the GET `/posts` Endpoint

Just send <kbd>GET</kbd>`/posts` request from the `requests.rest` file as is.
You should see **_Unauthorized_** in the response.

![Response](images/10-01.png)

Now add an _Authorization_ header to the request in the line below the <kbd>GET</kbd>`/posts` request with a wrong token:
```http
#######################################
GET http://localhost:3000/posts
Authorization: Bearer thisTokenIsObviouslyWrong
```
and hit `Send Request`.
You'll get **_Forbidden_** status in the response.

![Response](images/10-02.png)

Get the correct token by sending <kbd>POST</kbd>`/login` request, copy it and add it to the header:
```http
#######################################
GET http://localhost:3000/posts
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJuYW1lIjoiSmFuZSIsImlhdCI6MTYzMzUyNjYwMX0.VD8o8dGKben_XdDxKt4oEmkMzJeQrWhk8i4bqNVa2-Q
```
>**:bulb: TIP:** You will certainly get a different token than in the code snippet above, because it changes everytime the timestamp changes on your system.
The reason is that in the token's payload the `"iat"` JSON field (generated automatically by the `jsonwebtoken` library) contains the current timestamp.
It stands for _Issued At_ and holds the token creation timestamp (in seconds).
It's one of the [standard JWT claims](https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml).

Now the response body should look the same as in [chapter 06](#06), i.e. it should contain the 2 posts you created earlier.
So how do you filter the data in the response based on the author?

# 11 - Filter the Data Based on the Token

In order to do that, you just need to use the information that is inside the token's payload, field `name`.
In the `verifyToken` method, rename the too-generic `obj` to `payload`.
>**:bulb: TIP:** Use `console.log(payload)` to see what's in there whenever this _route handler_ is ivoked.
You should see something like this in the terminal:
>```javascript
>   { name: 'Jane', iat: 1633526601 }
>```
Just before passing the processing of the request to the `next` _route handler_, add a custom JSON object `user` to the request.
This object has a single field `name` with value coming from the token payload's field `name`:
```javascript
    jwt.verify(token, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, (err, payload) => {
        if (err) return res.sendStatus(403)
        req.user = { name: payload.name }
        next()
    })
```
In the last _route handler_ in <kbd>GET</kbd>`/posts` endpoint, instead of returning the full `posts` array, filter it based on post's `author` field:
```javascript
    res.json(posts.filter(p => p.author === req.user.name))
```
When you send the <kbd>GET</kbd>`/posts` request (in `requests.rest` file) now, you will no longer see all posts, just those where `author` field is the same as `name` in the token.

<div id="11-01">

![Response](images/11-01.png)

>**:bulb: TIP:** Replace the token in <kbd>GET</kbd>`/posts` request with John's token and see what posts are returned.

# 12 - Working with JWTs across Different Servers

To see how easy it is to work with the token across different servers (meaning you login on server "A" and display the posts on server "B"), make a copy of the `apiServer.js` and call it `authServer.js`. Run this in the terminal:
```
cp apiServer.js authServer.js
```
Add a startup command for the new server to the `package.json`, just after the `"apiStart":` field :
```json
    "authStart": "nodemon authServer.js",
```
Add new `AUTH_SERVER_PORT` env variable to `.env` file:
```properties
AUTH_SERVER_PORT=4000
```
And use it for the `PORT` of your new `authServer.js`:
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.AUTH_SERVER_PORT
```
Run both servers from the separate terminals:
```
npm run apiStart
```
```
npm run authStart
```
>**:bulb: TIP:** You can either open a new terminal or split the existing terminal in _VSCode_.
To do that, focus into your terminal (click inside it) and hit <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> (for new terminal) or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>5</kbd> (for split terminal).
I prefer the split option, because I can see what's going on in both terminals simultaneously.

![Split Terminal](images/12-01.png)

Now that both servers are running, in `requests.rest` alter the <kbd>POST</kbd>`/login` request to use port 4000 (i.e. different server), copy the `accessToken` and paste it in the original <kbd>GET</kbd>`/posts` on the `port 3000`:
```http
#######################################
GET http://localhost:3000/posts
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJuYW1lIjoiSmFuZSIsImlhdCI6MTYzMzYyNTE4NH0.bXl9QVdcclzhvYIoFAKL44ErafUiRlwN0RDQ2bkWhEI

#######################################
POST http://localhost:4000/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "username": "Jane",
    "password": "abcd"
}
```
You should see the same response as in [chapter 11 screenshot](#11-01) where you used the same server for both requests.

Key thing here is that both servers share the same `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` and thus are able to work with the token that was signed by it.
This is something that would be hard to do if you used sessions to handle this type of situation, because session is bound to a particular server.
But with JWT, the needed information is actually stored within the token itself and once issued, it lives on its own inside the requests themselves.

# 13 - Cleanup the Server Code

You now have 2 servers that will fulfill 2 different roles.
The `apiServer.js` will serve the data if the token is valid, and the `authServer.js` will issue the tokens.

Remove the authentication stuff from the `apiServer.js`:
* remove the whole <kbd>POST</kbd>`/login` endpoint

And remove the API stuff from the `authServer.js`:
* remove the whole <kbd>GET</kbd>`/posts` endpoint
* remove the `posts` array

Keep the `verifyToken` function in both.

# 14 - Set Expiration for the Access Token

Now, stop for a moment and think about the access token.
Each and every access token that is generated by the <kbd>POST</kbd>`/login` endpoint can be used indefinitely.
Not very secure, is it? No, it's **_NOT_**.

What can you do to stop the token from being used?
Well, you can change your ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET on the server, but it's not really a convenient way to invalidate an existing token.
If nothing else, changing the secret will invalidate **all tokens** that were ever signed by that secret in the past.
Maybe that's not what you want to do.

So, how do you make a specific token invalid?
There are more ways to directly or indirectly make a token invalid.

One of the most common ways is to set an expiry date for the issued token.
In real life, depending on the use-case this is set to a reasonably short time, usually minutes, hours or days.
The shorter the expiration time is, the more secure the token becomes.
In case the token is stolen, it can be only used for a limited period of time.

Add a utility method
```javascript
function createAccessToken(user) {
    return jwt.sign(user, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, { expiresIn: "15s" })
}
```

and change how the `accessToken` is generated in the <kbd>POST</kbd>`/login` endpoint in `authServer.js`:
```javascript
    const accessToken = createAccessToken(user)
```

Now, when you login and use the newly generated token, you can access the <kbd>GET</kbd>`/posts` for 15 seconds.
After that, you will no longer be able to display the posts.
Instead, you'll get **_403 Forbidden_** HTTP status.
You would need to login again to get the new access token.
You can test it now using `request.rest`.

>**:bulb: TIP:** Go ahead to the [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) and paste the new token there to see that a new _claim_ was added to the payload, `"exp": <timestamp>`.
It stands for _Expiration Time_ and if you compare it to the `"iat"` you'll see it's 15s greater.
It's just another one of [standard JWT claims](https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml) that you can find in JWTs.

# 15 - Create a Refresh Token

In previous chapter you made sure that the token cannot be used indefinitely.

But what should user do when his access token expires?
Well, you can ask the user to login again, but that is not a good user experience and authenticating a user can be a costly operation.
Here's where refresh tokens come into play.

Usually, after user logs in, login response contains not just the access token, but also a refresh token.
In terms of content, it's just another JWT, like the access token.
While access token is short-lived, refresh token is meant to be long-lived.
You will actually create a refresh token that will have _no expiration_ and you will handle the expiration (or invalidation) explicitly in the code, for example when user logs out.
Whenever an access token expires, you will send a request to refresh your access token by using - you guessed it - refresh token.

To generate a new secret for the refresh token run this in the terminal:
```bash
node -p "require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex')"
```

Create `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` environment variable in the `.env` file with the generated value, e.g.:
```properties
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=d734cf2b229686c7f0314fb680559c7822b381ae7f357cbf46967afd3fe2151677f907da3bb2acd7603939e989cdda24438def585436dd2cdb958680766d7966
```

In order to keep track of the refresh tokens and to have an ability to invalidate them, you need to store them somewhere.
Usually it's done in a fast database like [Redis](https://redis.io/).
In this tutorial you will just use an array of refresh tokens inside the `authServer.js` code.
Declare an empty array of refresh tokens before the <kbd>POST</kbd>`/login` endpoint:
```javascript
let refreshTokens = []
```

Change the <kbd>POST</kbd>`/login` endpoint to also create a refresh token.
Remember, refresh token has no expiration.
Add this under the creation of the access token:
```javascript
    const refreshToken = jwt.sign(user, process.env.REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET)
```

Store the new refresh token in the array you created and add it to the existing response.
```javascript
    refreshTokens.push(refreshToken)
    res.json({ accessToken: accessToken, refreshToken: refreshToken })
```

Finally, test your changes by sending a <kbd>POST</kbd>`/login` request to the server.
You will get a response containing access AND refresh token:

![Response](images/15-01.png)

# 16 - Getting a New Access Token Based on a Refresh Token

Let's adjust the existing `verifyToken` function to work with the _refresh tokens_. It will be similar to the `verifyToken` function that is used in <kbd>GET</kbd>`/posts` endpoint in `apiServer.js` with 2 small differences:
* if the `Authorization` header contains seemingly valid token it will next check refresh token "storage" that you created in the previous chapter for an existence of the incoming refresh token to confirm that such token was indeed issued previously and return **_403 Forbidden_** if it wasn't
  ```javascript
      if (!refreshTokens.includes(token)) return res.sendStatus(403)
  ```
* since it's not an access token now but refresh token, you must use the correct secret to verify the signature in `jwt.verify()` function:
  ```javascript
      jwt.verify(token, process.env.REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET, (err, payload) => {
  ```

Create a new <kbd>GET</kbd>`/accessToken` endpoint in `authServer.js` that will verify the refresh token in the request (using the adjusted `verifyToken` _route handler_) and return a new access token valid for another 15s:
```javascript
app.get("/accessToken", verifyToken, (req, res) => {
    const user = req.user
    const accessToken = createAccessToken(user)
    res.json({ accessToken: accessToken })
})
```

Now, when user's _access token_ expires, he's able to request a new one by calling the <kbd>GET</kbd>`/accessToken` given that a valid _refresh token_ is provided in the header.
All this without being required to login again.

Add the new request to `requests.rest` to try it out:
```html
#######################################
GET http://localhost:4000/accessToken
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJuYW1lIjoiSmFuZSIsImlhdCI6MTYzNDUwOTUxNX0.pM4SAXRNy4QcCdFgmtr5xmSKazkF-V-RXEJKT2nu5us
```

# 17 - Add a Logout Endpoint

As long as the server has the _refresh token_ in its storage, user is able to use it to get the new _access token_.
If you login, you get a refresh token which is stored in the `refreshTokens` array and as long as it is there, you can use it indefinitely to get a new valid access token.

Let's create a <kbd>DELETE</kbd>`/logout` endpoint in `authServer.js` that will remove the supplied refresh token from the server's storage so that nobody will be able to use it anymore to get an access token.
>**:bulb: TIP:** Even though it can be virtually any HTTP method, make it a <kbd>DELETE</kbd> because you will be deleting something from the server.
```javascript
app.delete("/logout", (req, res) => {
    const refreshToken = req.body.refreshToken
    refreshTokens = refreshTokens.filter(token => token !== refreshToken)
    res.sendStatus(204)
})
```

To test the endpoint, create a new request in `requests.rest`:
```html
#######################################
DELETE http://localhost:4000/logout
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "refreshToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJuYW1lIjoiSmFuZSIsImlhdCI6MTYzNTAwNjI1NX0.1ktdYG8iENKlrbMs5iSmiUkbsUd-9lkCmuqnYA3mthc"
}
```

If everything is correct, you will receive **204 No Content** HTTP status in the response.
The server will remove the token it got in the request body from the `refreshTokens` array and this refresh token will no longer work in the <kbd>GET</kbd>`/accessToken` endpoint.

You might be asking yourself, what about the access token?
Nothing was done about it in the <kbd>DELETE</kbd>`/logout` endpoint.
Well yes, it will still work but that's why you set a short expiration in it.

![Logout](images/logout-meme.jpg)

>You can use a DB that has TTL option on documents which would be set to the amount of time left until the token is expired.
>**Redis** is a good option for this, that will allow fast in memory access to the list.
>Then, in a middleware that runs on every authorized request, you should check if provided token is in The Blacklist.
>If it is, you should throw an unauthorized error.
>And if it is not, let it go and the JWT verification will handle it and identify whether it is expired or still active.

>In short, you should follow these 4 points:
>1. Set a reasonable expiration time on tokens
>2. Delete the stored token from client side upon log out
>3. Have DB of no longer active tokens that still have some time to live
>4. Query provided token against The Blacklist on every authorized request
