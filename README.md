  <h1 align="center">JWT + Node.js + Express Tutorial</h1>
</p>

Simple example on how to work with _JWT_ using _Node.js_ and _Express.js_ with _VSCode_ running in _WSL_ with _Ubuntu_ distro.

>**Disclaimer:** I was heavily inspired by [this great video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbsmsi7l3r4) by [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw)

# Prerequisites
* [Visual Studio Code on WSL](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl)
    * VSCode extension [Remote - WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl)
    * VSCode extension [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) - you can use any other REST client you are comfortable with, e.g. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
    You will use it to test the calls to the API endpoints we're going to create
* [nvm, node.js and npm](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl#install-nvm-nodejs-and-npm) on _WSL_ (the instructions are perfectly OK for _WSL 1_, too) - install the recommended LTS version of the node.js

>**Note:** Actually you don't need to use _VSCode_ or _WSL_, it's up to you. I chose this combination because:
* VSCode is a great IDE and works very well with Node.js
* It has a very powerful integrated terminal 
* I like Bash shell more than Windows PowerShell or Cmd 

# Setting up the Workspace
There are several ways to open the _WSL_ prompt, one is to hit <kbd>WIN</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to open the _Run_ dialog and typing `wsl` into the text box followed by <kbd>ENTER</kbd>. A _WSL_ prompt should open like this:

![WSL Prompt](images/wsl-prompt.png)

Next, you're going to create a `vscode` dir in your user home directory and clone this repository into it. In _WSL_ prompt, type:
```
cd ~ && mkdir vscode && cd vscode/
```
```
git clone https://github.com/krokyk/jwt-nodejs-express-tutorial.git
```
>**:bulb: TIP:** You can also clone the repository using SSH but you need to [setup your SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) first:
>```
>git clone git@github.com:krokyk/jwt-nodejs-express-tutorial.git
>```

>**:bulb: TIP:** You can also just [download the ZIP](https://github.com/krokyk/jwt-nodejs-express-tutorial/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) archive of this project from github and unzip it into the `vscode` dir (rename the folder to `jwt-nodejs-express-tutorial` if necessary).

Now, launch _VSCode_ in the newly created dir
```
code jwt-nodejs-express-tutorial/
```
You can close _WSL_ prompt now. You will be working exclusively in _VSCode_ from now on.

Inspect the contents of the project.
You can ignore the `images` dir (it contains images for this readme) but take a look into the one called `chapter-src`.

This dir holds files arranged into subdirs which reflect their "evolution" as they are created/changed.
These subdirs are numbered and each number represents a certain state of the project content.
The content matches the content you should have in your project root dir if you follow the tutorial.
The subchapters here are numbered the same way, so after you finish one subchapter, your files should have the same content as those you find under `chapter-src` subdir with the same number.

>**:bulb: TIP:** It's best to compare the contents of the project dir with each of the subdirs in `chapter-src` dir as you go through the tutorial chapters. You can use any tool that is able to compare the directory contents and easily display changed files and then compare those files to see what the change from that chapter is. My tool of choice for that is [Beyond Compare](https://www.scootersoftware.com/)

# 01 - Initialize the Project

```
npm init -y
```
Notice that `package.json` was created with some default values derived from our current content.

# 02 - Install Required Libraries

```
npm install express jsonwebtoken dotenv
```
* `express` for our server code and API endpoints
* `jsonwebtoken` for working with _JWT_
* `dotenv` to store our sensitive and configuration stuff inside the `.env` file (like secrets or ports)

Install the development dependency `nodemon` which will automatically restart the server as you make changes to the code:
```
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

# 03 - Create Project Files

```
touch apiServer.js && touch .env
```
* `apiServer.js` will contain our API code
* `.env` will contain our configuration

Inside the `package.json`, hook the `nodemon` to run newly created `apiServer.js`:
```json
  "scripts": {
    "apiStart": "nodemon apiServer.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
```
You can now try to run the `apiServer.js` with `nodemon`:

```
npm run apiStart
```
![Nodemon starts](images/03-01.png)

Now, without quitting the server, try adding
```javascript
console.log("Hi!")
```
to the `apiServer.js` and you should see the output in the terminal immediately after you save the file, because `nodemon` is monitoring it.

![Nodemon refreshes the server](images/03-02.png)

# 04 - Letâ€™s Create API Server

Add `API_SERVER_PORT` env variable to `.env` file:
```properties
API_SERVER_PORT=3000
```
And this to the empty `apiServer.js`:
```javascript
require("dotenv").config()
const PORT = process.env.API_SERVER_PORT

const express = require("express")
const app = express()

app.listen(PORT)
```
It will do nothing yet, just listen on the port configured via `.env`.

# 05 - Return Some Data

Create a <kbd>GET</kbd>`/posts` endpoint in `apiServer.js` that returns a simple JSON object containing 2 posts:
```javascript
const posts = [
    {
        author: "Jane",
        title: "Post 1"
    },
    {
        author: "John",
        title: "Post 2"
    }
]

app.get("/posts", (req, res) => {
    res.json(posts)
})
```
You can test the endpoint by opening http://localhost:3000/posts in your browser.
But we're going to...

<div id="06"></div>

# 06 - Use the [REST Client Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) to Display Data

It can run requests defined in the `*.rest` files.
File can contain multiple requests separated by three (or more) `###`.
Create file `requests.rest` in your project by running this in terminal:
```
touch requests.rest
```
With following content:
```http
#######################################
GET http://localhost:3000/posts
```
In the editor, it will look like this:

![requests.rest](images/06-01.png)

Now, you can click on `Send Request` and the resulting response will open in the new split window:

![Response](images/06-02.png)

This is all nice, but what if you don't want to display the whole content to anyone, but only the content they are authors of?
You need to add some authentication to the server to do that.

# 07 - Add an Authentication Endpoint

* Create a <kbd>POST</kbd>`/login` endpoint in `apiServer.js`.
* It's <kbd>POST</kbd>, because you are going to be sending data (credentials) to the server.
* Since the request body will be in a JSON format, you need to tell that to the server by configuring the middleware, so it understands the body of such requests. To configure _Express.js_ in such a way use this construct:
  ```javascript
  app.use(express.json())
  ```
  >**:information_source: INFO:** In short, middleware are those methods/functions/operations that are called **_between_** receiving the request and  sending back the response.
* The endpoint should take care of the authentication of the user, but this is not in scope of this tutorial.
  You can just assume the authentication was successful and the user really is who he claims to be.
  Add this to the `apiServer.js`:
  ```javascript
  app.post("/login", (req, res) => {
    // Authenticate the user here, e.g. by checking username and password against a database
    // ...
  })
  ```
* So take the `username` from the request body and use it in creation of `user` object that will be stored inside the generated token. Add this to the <kbd>POST</kbd>`/login` endpoint method:
  ```javascript
    const username = req.body.username // username from the request
    const user = { name: username } // user object that is going to be a part of the token
  ```
* Import the `jsonwebtoken` library.
  ```javascript
  const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken")
  ```
* To create the token and send it back to the client, add this to the <kbd>POST</kbd>`/login` endpoint method:
  ```javascript
    const accessToken = jwt.sign(user, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)
    res.json({ accessToken: accessToken })
  ```
* Store the secret inside the `.env` file. You can use _Node.js_ `crypto` library to generate a strong secret (e.g. 64 random bytes converted to a hexadecimal string). Paste this into **terminal** (yes, you can paste the whole line, including the comment :wink:):
  ```bash
  node -p "require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex')" # -p prints out the evaluated input
  ```
  Each time you run that a new random string is generated.
  Create `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` environment variable in the `.env` file with that value, e.g.:
  ```properties
  ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=9fef66c25daba5b9a28a59f82e4bd799c83d891f4dae047c27c60796c0b5a9732cf66b87c21836f8df1ef8580de72b4c5d1197a6e811063d3b1ed03ed4fb8bb7
  ```

# 08 - Test the POST `/login` Endpoint

Add the <kbd>POST</kbd>`/login` request to the `requests.rest`:
```http
#######################################
POST http://localhost:3000/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "username": "Jane",
    "password": "abcd"
}
```

The response will look like this:

![Response](images/08-01.png)

That gibberish is actually our access token holding the information we've put in it (our `user` JSON object) along with some other stuff, added automatically by the `jsonwebtoken` library.
>**:bulb: TIP:** You can actually head out to the [official JWT page](https://jwt.io/) and paste your token there to see what's in it.

# 09 - Verify the Access Token in the Middleware

* in `apiServer.js` create a middleware function (or _route handler_) called `verifyToken`
  ```javascript
  function verifyToken(req, res, next) {
      
  }
  ```
* add it to the <kbd>GET</kbd>`/posts` endpoint to the chain of our _route handlers_
  ```javascript
  app.get("/posts", verifyToken, (req, res) => {
      res.json(posts)
  })
  ```
Inside `verifyToken` function:
* extract the _Authorization_ header from the request
  ```javascript
      const authHeader = req.headers["authorization"]
  ```
* Verify there is actually such header and if yes, get the token from it.
Since _Authorization_ header value will be in format `Bearer <token>`, split it (on the `space` character) and take the second array element from it
  ```javascript
      const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(" ")[1]
  ```
* if the header is not there or the value of the header is malformed somehow (e.g. there's no space between `Bearer` and `<token>`), return **_401 Unauthorized_** HTTP status
  ```javascript
      if (token == null) return res.sendStatus(401)
  ```
* otherwise, proceed to the verification of the token itself.
If there's an error, return **_403 Forbidden_** HTTP status. If not, pass the control to the `next` _route handler_ in sequence
  ```javascript
      jwt.verify(token, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, (err, obj) => {
          if (err) return res.sendStatus(403)
          next()
      })
  ```

# 10 - Test the GET `/posts` Endpoint

Just send <kbd>GET</kbd>`/posts` request from the `requests.rest` file as is. You should see **_Unauthorized_** in the response.

![Response](images/10-01.png)

Now add an _Authorization_ header to the request in the line below the <kbd>GET</kbd>`/posts` request with a wrong token:
```http
#######################################
GET http://localhost:3000/posts
Authorization: Bearer thisTokenIsObviouslyWrong
```
and hit `Send Request`. You'll get **_Forbidden_** status in the response.

![Response](images/10-02.png)

Get the correct token by sending <kbd>POST</kbd>`/login` request, copy it and add it to the header:
```http
#######################################
GET http://localhost:3000/posts
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJuYW1lIjoiSmFuZSIsImlhdCI6MTYzMzUyNjYwMX0.VD8o8dGKben_XdDxKt4oEmkMzJeQrWhk8i4bqNVa2-Q
```
>**:bulb: TIP:** You will certainly get a different token than in the code snippet above, because it changes everytime the timestamp changes on your system.
The reason is that in the token's payload the `"iat"` JSON field (generated automatically by the `jsonwebtoken` library) contains the current timestamp.

Now the response body should look the same as in [chapter 06](#06), i.e. it should contain the 2 posts you created earlier.
So how do you filter the data in the response based on the author?

# 11 - Filter the Data Based on the Token

In order to do that, you just need to use the information that is inside the token's payload, field `name`. In the `verifyToken` method, rename the too-generic `obj` to `payload`.
>**:bulb: TIP:** Use `console.log(payload)` to see what's in there whenever this _route handler_ is ivoked.
You should see something like this in the terminal:
>```javascript
>   { name: 'Jane', iat: 1633526601 }
>```
Just before passing the processing of the request to the `next` _route handler_, add a custom JSON object `user` to the request.
This object has a single field `name` with value coming from the token payload's field `name`:
```javascript
    jwt.verify(token, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, (err, payload) => {
        if (err) return res.sendStatus(403)
        req.user = { name: payload.name }
        next()
    })
```
In the last _route handler_ in <kbd>GET</kbd>`/posts` endpoint, instead of returning the full `posts` array, filter it based on post's `author` field:
```javascript
    res.json(posts.filter(p => p.author === req.user.name))
```
When you send the <kbd>GET</kbd>`/posts` request (in `requests.rest` file) now, you will no longer see all posts, just those where `author` field is the same as `name` in the token.

<div id="11-01">

![Response](images/11-01.png)

>**:bulb: TIP:** Replace the token in <kbd>GET</kbd>`/posts` request with John's token and see what posts are returned.

# 12 - Working with JWTs across Different Servers

To see how easy it is to work with the token across different servers (meaning you login on server "A" and display the posts on server "B"), make a copy of the `apiServer.js` and call it `authServer.js`. Run this in the terminal:
```
cp apiServer.js authServer.js
```
Add a startup command for the new server to the `package.json`, just after the `"apiStart":` field :
```json
    "authStart": "nodemon authServer.js",
```
Add new `AUTH_SERVER_PORT` env variable to `.env` file:
```properties
AUTH_SERVER_PORT=4000
```
And use it for the `PORT` of your new `authServer.js`:
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.AUTH_SERVER_PORT
```
Run both servers from the separate terminals:
```
npm run apiStart
```
```
npm run authStart
```
>**:bulb: TIP:** You can either open a new terminal or split the existing terminal in _VSCode_.
To do that, focus into your terminal (click inside it) and hit <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> (for new terminal) or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>5</kbd> (for split terminal).
I prefer the split option, because I can see what's going on in both terminals simultaneously.

![Split Terminal](images/12-01.png)

Now that both servers are running, in `requests.rest` alter the <kbd>POST</kbd>`/login` request to use port 4000 (i.e. different server), copy the `accessToken` and paste it in the original <kbd>GET</kbd>`/posts` on the `port 3000`:
```http
#######################################
GET http://localhost:3000/posts
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJuYW1lIjoiSmFuZSIsImlhdCI6MTYzMzYyNTE4NH0.bXl9QVdcclzhvYIoFAKL44ErafUiRlwN0RDQ2bkWhEI

#######################################
POST http://localhost:4000/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "username": "Jane",
    "password": "abcd"
}
```
You should see the same response as in [chapter 11 screenshot](#11-01) where you used the same server for both requests.

Key thing here is that both servers share the same `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` and thus are able to work with the token that was signed by it. This is something that would be hard to do if you used sessions to handle this type of situation, because session is bound to a particular server. But with JWT, the needed information is actually stored within the token itself and once issued, it lives on its own inside the requests themselves.

# 13 - Cleanup the Server Code

You now have 2 servers that will fulfill 2 different roles.
The `apiServer.js` will serve the data if the token is valid, and the `authServer.js` will issue the tokens.

Remove the authentication stuff from the `apiServer.js`:
* remove the whole <kbd>POST</kbd>`/login` endpoint

And remove the API stuff from the `authServer.js`:
* remove the whole <kbd>GET</kbd>`/posts` endpoint
* remove the `posts` array

Keep the `verifyToken` function in both.
